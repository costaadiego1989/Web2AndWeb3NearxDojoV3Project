### ZoonersWallet 

This project is part of a DOJO challenge created by [Lucas Oliveira]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivmath?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BlpvG1FrZTtCwVHcMeAIarw%3D%3D)) at [NearX Innovation]([url](https://nearx.com.br/pt/home)). 

## Getting Started

The idea was to create a custom wallet to interact with a deployed contract created with Solidity.
This version is as simple as possible and will be refactored soon.
We have 3 screens:
- splash
- authentication(disabled at this version)
- homepage

I will create a readme file describing the steps I used to code this app.
