# Zooners Message Front-end

This project is a front-end interface for interacting with a simple Message smart contract. It was developed using **React, TypeScript and Styled-Components** for styling. Additionally, context tools were implemented to manage the Wallet and MessageDisplay components.

The project is part of the **NearX** research group, specifically the 3rd version of DoJo, which aims to explore the integration of smart contracts with a user-friendly interface.
